						<p class="single_info">Jumping Between the Strings<p>
						<p class="single_info">The notes were graceful and delightful, yet the sound was choppy and awkward, like a mosquito humming around the practice room. The echo that bounced from the wall highlighted the twisted voice of the violin, imitating an agitated car screeching and squealing as it breaks suddenly. It seemed to be a total catastrophe, but not for me. I felt engaged and fascinated by the “special effects” that I could create from playing an instrument.</p>
						<p class="single_info">Playing a violin is not meant to be easy, nor is performing a spiccato. While I have enjoyed composing eccentric music, grasping the technique of how to bounce my bow continues to be my focus. My attempts to master a spiccato didn’t work until I accidentally jumped the bow between two strings. An unexpected mellow tone caught my ears—I had played a spiccato across the strings. I love how new concepts are discovered from beautiful accidents as such, just like how unconventional melodies are invented through free exploration.</p>
						<p class="single_info">I see myself in this particular moment of instrumental practice: a person who jumps between different identities. You suppose one should have an identity, yet one can possess a spectrum of identities. I spend time to perfect my violin skills, but I am also interested in joining a table tennis match. Acquiring tricks of calculus from mathematical models of quantum mechanics is undoubtedly fascinating, yet passing on the beauty of calculus to my fellow students as a teaching assistant is as inspiring. My Spanish teacher tries to urge me to learn some math terms in Spanish, whereas my English teacher has nothing to critique about my inspirational speech at the last graduation ceremony. During club time, being a peer tutor not only helps students who need academic support, but also allows me to make more friends whom I did not have a chance to know before. Behaving professionally and being a role model for my peers keep me motivated; nevertheless, I appreciate moments where I make humorous puns that send my friends into unquenchable laughter.</p>
						<p class="single_info">Such variety of identities comes from the voyage of creation and exploration. The establishment of my online publishing center, in particular, did not come from a light bulb that illuminated my direction. Rather, the idea originated from my constant contemplation of how to deliver extraordinary visual arts, and literary compositions created by students, to the school community; it came gradually. Before the layout of my website (www.polarize.pw) started to flow out of my pen, I had already been synthesizing scientific concepts with writing, aiming to raise the school community’s awareness of science. After meeting with my peers who also had the willingness to display their work, I transformed my self-learned knowledge of web development languages HTML and CSS to the taps on my keyboard. Who said you cannot be a scientist, a writer, a designer, and a programmer at the same time?</p>
						<p class="single_info">The bow can be jumped between the strings, so can one’s identity. Actively participating in a Student Council discussion, I contributed to activity planning from a Historian’s perspective. Sitting on the commentator’s chair, I humorously broadcasted the agile moves of players during a basketball competition. Shuffling my way through the crowd, I accurately captured the exhilarating moments of my school’s bonfire night. Yet, my commitment to the student community never stops. This year, I was elected as the Secretary of the Student Council, in which I focus on organizing the meeting notes and the logistics of various activities.</p>
						<p class="single_info">My identities alternate as the music plays on, harmonizing with my passion and commitment of service to the community. I look forward to extending the diversity of my skills and identities, making myself a more well-rounded yet focused individual. Wherever I go, whenever it is, the pleasant spiccato will continue to resonate.</p>
