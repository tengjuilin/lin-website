        <p class="article_paragraph">Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated majorly in Canada and the United States. It is on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. Thanksgiving Day began as a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Following the Mayflower’s arrival at Plymouth Rock on December 11, 1620, the Pilgrims suffered the loss of 45% of their population. With the help of Native Americans, the remaining Pilgrims survived the bitter winter and yielded ample food in 1621. In celebration, a traditional English harvest festival, lasting three days, brought the Pilgrims and natives to unite in a “thanksgiving” observance.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Following the previous tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving Day, Student Council made the bonfire party stand out from the previous Thanksgiving activities and included the traditional food-sharing activity. By the time the sun went down, Student Council members had set up the bonfire pit while excited students surrounded the fire side by side, willing to be involved in the process</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">The bonfire party soon began after the sky was covered by stars. As the president of Student Council Edgar announced the start of the party, the bonfire was lit up; it turned into a warm red glow. With the leadership of Mr. Trey, who presented his thanks to hard working math students and his appreciation for the Kinglee community, students such as Sky, Lana, Amy K., and Teddy got to the front and expressed their thanks to their staff, teachers, classmates, and parents. When the atmosphere of the party heated up, students and teachers started to share their snacks with each other, revealing their gratitude to each other personally</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">To add to the relaxing and delightful ambience, students from different classes volunteered to make performances in front of the Kinglee family. The seventh grade group danced swiftly under the song “Okey Dokey” and the cheer of their classmates, whereas Terry’s dance won the long-lasting applause from everyone, especially from his ninth grade cheering team. Followed by the solo music of Hanson from eighth grade, Betty and Karen, from eighth grade as well, also showed their talent of singing on the stage. Class Boxue from eighth grade then performed a chorus singing “I Love You China” to express their appreciation for the nation. Following the singing of tenth grade Teddy, the dancing team from eighth grade including Tina, Lucy, and Lisa had a wonderful dancing performance. With the enthusiastic cheers of students, Fred and Mary from twelfth and eleventh grade, respectively, performed rap among the crowd. As for one last surprise, the band from eleventh grade consisting of Nancy, Patricia, and Tiger beautifully sang the song “Red,” pushing the whole activity to a climax. Several other performances also won the appreciation of students. While students from all grades participated in the performance, Galvin and Michael as D.J. and technician helped students manage their music “back stage.”</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">After the fantastic student performances, T. Violet organized the reveal of the secret angels. Students found their secret angels and expressed their thanks to the ones who had been helping them for a week. After the secret angel ceremony, everybody got hand in hand and formed a huge circle around the bonfire pit. The circle soon broke off and reassembled around the fire. Some danced around the fire, some stood around and watched the crazy dances, some hugged each other to express their thankfulness, and some ran around the crowd and enjoyed the whole Thanksgiving atmosphere.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">The whole thanksgiving activity soon came to an end; students restored the field and packed up their food. “It is the most memorable and the most awesome night I have spent in Kinglee,” said Jon, a student from eleventh grade who commented on the event.</p>
