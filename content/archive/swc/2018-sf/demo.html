        <h2 class="article_subtitle">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="article_paragraph">The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between temperature and the rate of photosynthesis. The experiment will help to determine the best temperature for photosynthesis and the change in rate in different temperature. As known, the reactant of photosynthesis is water, carbon dioxide, and light energy. The final product of photosynthesis is glucose and oxygen. The reaction takes place in the chloroplast. At the beginning of the experiment, the gases within the leaf disks were extracted by syringe. The gas that allows the leaf disks to float is oxygen, which is a product of photosynthesis. By measuring the formation of oxygen indirectly from ET<sub>50</sub> time, or the time required for 50% of the leaf disks to float, the relative rate of photosynthesis could be determined. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis determined in this experiment can be used in many places, such as space planting, greenhouse planting, and single plant cultivating. The hypothesis of this experiment is "if the temperature of the environment is in optimum for the chlorophyll, then the rate of photosynthesis will be the highest, because the increase or decrease from the optimum temperature will result in either denaturation of protein complex containing chlorophyll, or the electron acceptor, which will decrease the rate of photosynthesis."</p>

            <li>Pour 250mL bicarbonate solution into one beaker. Label the beaker as "Prepare".</li>
            <li>Use a pipette to add 1 mL soap solution into the "Prepare" beaker, avoid suds.</li>
            <li>Use a hole puncher to cut 20 uniform leaf disk for each temperature set. Avoid major leaf veins.</li>
            <li>Draw the gases out of all the leaf disk by doing following steps:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Remove the plunger from the syringe. Place 10 leaf disk into each syringe barrel.</li>
                    <li>Replace the plunger to the syringe. Push the plunger and leave only a small amount of air and leaf disk remain.</li>
                    <li>Pull 5mL solution inside the "Prepare" beaker. Suspend the leaf disk in the solution by tapping. Remove the air inside the syringe by moving the plunger.</li>
                    <li>Create a vacuum by holding a finger over the syringe opening while drawing back the plunger. Hold the vacuum for about 1 seconds. While holding the vacuum, suspend the leaf disk by swirling. Release the vacuum by letting the plunger spring back. Do not Place the disks under vacuum more than three times or the disks will be damaged.</li>
                    <li>Push the liquid back to the "Prepare" beaker, and place the leaf disks into the "Experiment" beaker, avoid lights</li>
                    <li>Redo the step to draw the gas out for all the leaf disks.</li>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Pour 60°C water in a water-resisting container, put the "Experiment" beaker inside the container for 2 minutes.</li>

        <h2 class="article_subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="article_paragraph">This experiment was done to test the effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis by measuring the time it took for leaf disks to float in different temperature, while other condition was held the same. The hypothesis "If the temperature of the environment is in optimum for the chlorophyll, then the rate of photosynthesis will be the highest, because the increase or decrease from the optimum temperature will result in either denaturation of protein complex containing chlorophyll, or the electron acceptor, which will decrease the rate of photosynthesis" was supported.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">According to the data, the optimum temperature for chlorophyll for spinach was 15°C. The 15°C group had the shortest ET<sub>50</sub> time (the time required for 50% of the leaf disks to float), which showed the group had the highest photosynthesis rate, thus 15°C was the optimum temperature. Also, the decline of rate coupled with increase or decrease of the temperature also supported the hypothesis. Comparing 5°C group with 15°C group, the ET<sub>50</sub> time in minutes significantly increased, which reflected the 5°C group has decreased in the rate of photosynthesis because of the decrease of temperature. Theoretically, the decrease in optimum temperature will result in decrease of the movement of chemicals involved in photosynthesis (i.e. the movement of electrons, and protons), which will decrease the rate of photosynthesis. While the temperature increases from the optimum temperature, the movement of chemicals will increase. However, high temperature will denature the protein complex containing chlorophyll by breaking its hydrogen bonds that holds the secondary structure, altering its shape. Since a protein's specific structure determines its function, the alteration of its structure will result in the lost of function, slowing down the rate of photosynthesis. Comparing 25°C group and 15°C group, the ET<sub>50</sub> time also increased, which reflected the 25°C group has decreased in the rate of photosynthesis because the decrease of temperature. </p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">The experiment may be improved in several ways. For example, the experiment only ran for one trial, which has relatively low accuracy. Increase the trails and take the average from the data will result in more accurate data. Also, the experiment only tested the effect of temperature on rate of photosynthesis of spinach, which is only valid for one plant species. Testing more plant species allows scientists to explore patterns within data, thus developing the evolutionary relationship between species. In addition, the environment temperature for testing (water temperature) tend to flow to the room temperature, obeying the second law of thermodynamics. This results in the inaccurate experiment variable. Although the addition of cold/hot water regulates the temperature, it slightly decreases the concentration of the sodium bicarbonate solution, result in inaccurate data. To improve the quality of the data, the "experiment" beaker should be bathed in water that has the same temperature as the group need. Furthermore, the light source could also generate heat, thus changing the temperature of the system. To avoid external factors, the "experiment" beaker should be covered by a shallow colorless dish that contains water, absorbing the heat. To do further research, scientists could test how temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis of different plant species, then look for the trend of C3, C4, and CAM plant.</p>
