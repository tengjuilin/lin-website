        <p class="article_paragraph">J.R Tolkien once said, "Not all those who wander are lost, and not all that is gold glitters." All of us are pilgrims wandering on a long winding road. Everyday, we trek a little further and rest at night. At dawn, we are welcomed by gorgeous sunsets painted in warm vibrant colors; at dusk, we are greeted by magnificent skies decorated with twinkling silver stars. Life is a thrilling adventure, and we are all explorers discovering something new about our life each day. I have walked on this trail for 17 years and have never stopped feeling amazed at just how wonderful life can be. Sure, there are always rivers to cross and mountains to climb, but all these challenges just make you stronger and smarter. And one day, you will finally reach the end of the road and enter into a blissful paradise. I believe that it takes confidence and courage for one to successfully reach the paradise at the end of the road.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Every child has been told to believe in themselves, to believe that dreams can come true, and that they can do anything if they try their best. You've probably heard the saying "Laughter is the best medicine.", I think what the saying should be "Confidence is the best medicine." Having confidence means that you believe that you are the best, it means that you believe that you can achieve everything. Confidence magically lifts your spirit up whenever you're feeling down, it can change a grumpy frown to a cheerful smile within seconds. A person with confidence can live life with joy knowing that they can face any challenges they come across. Confidence allows you to live the best version of yourself and live the fullest life you can live. And often times, we need some encouragement to let our confidence shine through.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Every child has been told to face their fears, to trust that everything will be alright after the light breaks through the dark storm clouds. Confidence is connected with courage. If you are confident than you also are courageous, because you truly believe that you can do anything, that makes you fearless. If you're fearless than you'll be able to do anything without a single trace of fear. When life's troubles trips you and makes you fall, courageous people always stand up right away. When you have courage on your side, it's like having a indestructible shield that keeps you safe and unharmed.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Life is a journey that needs to be traveled, life is a story that needs to be written, life is a movie that needs to be acted, life is a song that needs to be sung, life is a game that needs to be played and life is a race that needs to be run. Sometimes life is a stormy ocean, the giant waves rise and fall, the ever-changing tide pushes and pulls, and the roaring ocean crashes violently against the beach. Sometimes life is a calm ocean, the clear blue water shimmers under the sun light, the waves gently move along with the tide, and the peaceful ocean brushes against the sandy shore. Confidence and courage are like sun rays shining through a dark cloud. I believe that if a person has confidence and courage, then they will always be ready when ever the ocean changes its mood, their ship will never sink but sail on to a new land.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">And before I end this, I will read you all a poem:</p>
        <p class="poem_line"><b>Remember</b></p>
        <p class="poem_line">Remember the light at the end of the road,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">The beacon of the future shines for you,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">And hope is reaching out her hand to greet you.</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Remember the stars that shine at night,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">The heavens opens up a land of wonder,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">A land of endless sparkling dreams.</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Remember the vast green pasture of growth,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Mother Earth who natured you everyday,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">And the Sun who watches you as you play.</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Remember everything,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">The high, the low,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">And don't forget that you're a star,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Wandering in the universe,</p>
        <p class="poem_line">Waiting for another day to come.</p>
