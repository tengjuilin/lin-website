        <p class="article_paragraph">I heard a soft knock on Nick's front door and Nick leapt from his chair to open it. Less than a minute later I saw Gatsby walk in the room like all his joints were stiff. He was soaking rain like he forgot his umbrella on his way here, he had a strange expression on his face that I couldn't really describe, it was a mix of relief, sorrow and joy.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">And I meant it. From what I remember, Gatsby was a nice gentleman.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">He leaned on the mantel pretending to be at ease but I could tell he wasn't comfortable. He had his hands jammed in his pants' pockets like they were glued in place. "We've met before." He muttered.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">I heard Daisy coming and I just panicked. I haven't seen her in such a long time so I was scared. I escaped through the back door and walk slowly to the front door. In the rain. I was dripping wet when I reached the front door. I hesitated. Would Daisy want to even see me? Did she feel the same way I did? We're all my dreams just dreams? I knocked on the door and Nick opened it. I must have looked pathetic because Nick stared at me strangely. I ignored him and walked over to Daisy.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Daisy look at me and smiled sweetly. "I certainly am awfully glad to see you again." She said in an melodious voice.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Those words were like music to my ears.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">I leaned on the mantel out of unease and I managed to say "We've met before." Which felt like a very lame thing to say but I was tongue tied.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Nick came into the room shortly after. Gatsby was still leaning on the mantel and the old clock his head was resting on fell. Gatsby caught it before it crashed and apologized to Nick. "I'm sorry about the clock." He said as he finally sat down (a bit rigidly) on the sofa. "It's an old clock." Nick said his face red.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">I smiled than looked at the old clock, I thought about all the time that had past by since I last saw Gatsby, he looked the same and felt the same. But I felt different, my life has been different ever since I met Tom, it feels like being trapped in a cage, and I don't like it.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Nick came into the room, probably to check on us since we weren't talking. Then the clock on the mantel fell from the weight of my head (which was leaning against it). I quickly caught it before it fell. I sank into a nearby sofa and rested my chin on my hand. "I'm sorry about the clock." I apologized. "It's an old clock." Nick said awkwardly.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Daisy was quiet, like she was lost in her own thoughts, her own world. Maybe it was wrong of me to do this. The hands on that old clock continued to move, but I wished it could stop, rewind and go back to the day I met Daisy.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">The silence felt awkward, so I said rather mater-factly "We haven’t met for many years." "Five years next November." Gatsby replied automatically. It was as if that date was carved in his mind and heart so he would never forget it. I quickly stood up, to my surprise, at the same time Gatsby did, and we both asked Nick to help us make some tea.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"We haven't met for many years." Daisy said. "Five years next November." I said. It was one of those times when something is in your head (or heart) and it escapes from your mouth without you realizing it till after you say it. I could see Daisy was surprised, and perhaps somewhat pleased as she was smiling her dainty smile again. I was about to stand up when I saw Daisy raising from the sofa as well, we asked Nick to help make us some tea in the kitchen.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">So we sat there drinking tea and eating these cute little cakes. Gatsby was very quiet, and very nervous. It felt awkward. Me and Nick talked a bit, then Nick made an excuse to get up and leave. Gatsby looked alarmed and uncomfortable as he asked "Where are you going?" "I'll be back." Nick promised. "I've got to speak to you before I go." Gatsby said urgently. So Gatsby followed Nick out of the room leaving me alone and puzzled. If Gatsby wanted to see me why couldn't he talk to me? Why was he so anxious?</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">We sat in Nick's dinning room having tea and cakes. The atmosphere didn't feel right so when Nick made up an excuse to leave I panicked. "Where are you going?" I asked trying to act like I was surprised he was leaving so soon. "I'll be back." Nick promised looking at me in a funny way. "I've got to speak to you before I go." I said sincerely. Nick didn't reply. I followed him outside closed the dinning room door. "This is a terrible mistake!" I whispered agitatedly. "No it's not." Nick said reassuringly. "You're just nervous. And Daisy is nervous too." "She is?" I asked. "Yes." Nick said looking at me like I lost my mind. "I should go back." I said. "Thanks old sport."</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">After whispering behind the closed door for a few minutes, Gatsby came back with a soft smile on his face. That's how I knew all the awkward nervousness that was plaguing him before was gone. Not even a single trace left. And I smiled back.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">When Nick came in suddenly I jumped and hurriedly wipes the tears that falling from my eyes like rain drops. Nick looked surprised. He wasn't there to hear Gatsby give that sweet speech to me, about how he loved me and how he longed for me.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">After talking with Nick, I came back to see Daisy still siting at the table sipping tea. She looked at me, and her eyes were questioning me. A single word, a single question — "Why?" . I smiled at her and she returned a smile, a kind and knowing smile.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">And then I told her my dream. I told her about how I always looked back to the night we met and that precious kiss we shared. I told her how I looked at that green light across the water I thought of her.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"I've always loved you Daisy, I love you with all my heart, mind and soul. And I'll never forget you. Never."</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Daisy was crying. Glistening tears were sliding down her delicate face.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"I've thought about you too, Jay." She said quietly.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">When she said those six words my face lit up with hope and I thought my heart would explode. It was as if the spark in my heart burst into fiery flames. Daisy did love me, my dreams weren't just dreams anymore, they were coming true.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">When Gatsby saw Nick he greeted him like a old friend who just came back from a long journey.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"It's stopped raining." He told Nick.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"Has it?" Nick remarked, sounding surprised.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"It's topped raining Daisy." He told me. "What do you think about that?"</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"I'm glad, Jay." I said happily. And I was truly happy.</p>
        <p class="section_separation">___</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">Nick came back just as the rain stopped.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"It's stopped raining." I told Nick.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"Has it?" Nick answered.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"It's topped raining Daisy." I told Daisy. "What do you think about that?"</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">"I'm glad, Jay." Daisy answered with a beautiful smile on her face that radiated joy.</p>
        <p class="article_paragraph">And my heart jumped for joy.</p>
