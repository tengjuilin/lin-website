                As a new member of Kinglee High School, all the things around will be new to you. The stranger sitting next to you may become your best friend in a week. The teacher who teaches you first hour may become the most influential person to your academic life. You never know how great an influence your actions have on your future. Adapt to the new place: make some new friends, know some teachers, and be involved in the clubs. You will gradually find yourself feeling at your home.

            <span class="content_section_text">
                In Kinglee, you will have both Chinese and English classes at the same time. While the Chinese classes build a solid foundation of basic knowledge, the English classes challenge your English skills in a variety of ways. To excel in classes, you will find it useful to connect the things you are learning in both classes. By drawing connections and inferences, you can understand the content much easier.

                Be brave and practice your English. Chat with your friends in English. It may feel funny in the beginning, but it will become natural over time. The most effective way to learn English is to use English by yourself. You will find that your English gets better every single day. Donâ€™t be afraid to find your teachers. Use your English to ask teachers questions, clarify any confusion, or report any issue you have encountered. Feel free to find them: teachers are here only to help you.

                You will find it useful to have some unique skills that sets you apart in the future; however, developing skills takes time. You should start to find one or two focused areas that you are interested in and keep working on it. No matter if it is playing basketball, painting, playing violin, or even skateboarding, the value of your interest is unmeasurable if you hold on to it over time.
