                In ninth grade, you will have five American classes, requiring you to put more effort into practicing English. It is also important to notice that your grade in ninth grade American classes will be used when applying to colleges. To display your full academic capability in your application, it is beneficial to start making some progress from ninth grade.

            <span class="content_section_text">
                When applying to colleges, another category that schools care about is extracurricular activities. Make sure that you join clubs and participate in activities, so you have the “outside-the-classroom you” to show in your application. More importantly, you can relieve some stress during these activities, not matter if it is basketball, board games, or movie club.

                Because of the enormous work load from both Chinese and English classes, it’s absolutely normal to feel stressed. It’s okay to be stressed to keep yourself motivated; however, if you really need help, feel free to express your problems with you friends and teachers. They will be happy to help you out and support you.

                Ninth grade is a challenging year. Everyone will have a hard time getting through it. It’s beneficial to be supportive of your classmate: encourage them, help them, and support them. When it comes to your time of need, you will also be taken care of by your supportive friends.
