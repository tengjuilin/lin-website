                Stop procrastinating! Start your work today, now! Starting assignments early will provide you so many advantages. It not only gives you time for revising your work, it also provides time for communication with teachers as well as flexibility for your schedule. Summer and winter homework, especially, should be completed in advance, instead of the day before the school starts.

                Many are worried about standardized test scores when applying to colleges, but it is not the only factor that admission officers consider. Your high school grades, especially, are considered one of the most important factors. Having a good academic record is the best way to demonstrate your academic capabilities. Consequently, working on your school work regularly will help you a lot when applying to colleges.
