                Vocabulary is important for everyday communication and school work. Recognize more essential vocabulary that frequently appear in your book will help you immensely. With those vocabulary words, you will be able to express your ideas freely and confidently. Practice and use those vocabulary in daily conversations, so you can make connections to your own experience.

            <span class="content_section_text">
                Donâ€™t limit yourself in your comfort zone, that is, your close friends. Try to make more friends besides your best friends. The new seventh graders who need help would be a good choice. In such process, you are not only helping others, you also making valuable social connections that are beneficial for your future.

                Have a note-taking strategy that is well-suited for yourself. Practice note-taking during class time, so that you are used to various situations and the content is recorded for reference. With a system that is created by yourself, you can review the content more efficiently. By practicing now, you are also preparing for ninth grade, a more challenging year for academics!
