                A red book is a Kinglee student handbook that displays the code of conduct and allows you to keep track of your homework and passwords. To make your life easier, form a habit of recording each day’s homework in your red book. Organizing your work is the first step of completing your work. You should also copy down important passwords at the back of the red book, just in case you forget.

                Form your own note-taking strategy in class. Follow your own style that you find efficient, so you can quickly recognize the key point that you should understand. Separate notes from different classes to different sections, so it’s clear when you are reviewing for a subject. You should also consider taking notes with blank piece of paper, since you will encounter times where you are not given lines for reference.
