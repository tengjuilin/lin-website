                Beyond challenging yourself academically through AP courses, you should also take some leadership opportunities. Student Council, for example, is a great place to display your leadership and use your ideas to improve student activities. The challenges should not, however, be limited to Student Council. Making speeches to the lower graders, solving problems for peers, or tutoring junior high students is also great chances to contribute to the school community.

                In eleventh grade, you need to prepare for your SAT to be competitive among the applicants. Similar to language test, the main point for the English section is to assess your ability to comprehend the passage and think critically, instead of testing your ability to recall vocabulary. To improve your score, use your class time and practice for reading texts, understanding texts, and analyzing text. You will find the knowledge learned in class extremely valuable.

                While you have to motivate yourself to study using free time in tenth grade, you have to learn how to find more time to deal with your work. With an increasing work load, you need to find time from your schedule, ranging from ten minutes before class starts to thirty minutes after lunch. Utilize the time that you have and turn it to work!
