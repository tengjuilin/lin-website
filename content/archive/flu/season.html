                Because flu is a disease infecting the respiratory system, it exhibits <a class="intext_citation" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm">symptoms</a> similar to common cold, such as cough, sour throat, tiredness, etc. However, flu generally has more severe symptoms and can even cause death in some cases because of the invasiveness of flu viruses.

The time of flu season in the United States varies by year, but it majorly comes during autumn and winter. Therefore, special care is needed to prevent flu infection during the flu season.
