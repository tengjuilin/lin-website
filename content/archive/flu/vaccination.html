                <a class="intext_citation" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm ">Flu shot will not give you flu</a> because of the composition of the vaccine. Typical vaccine is made of dead virus or part of the virus that cannot cause infection to produce protective immune response. Getting a flu after a flu shot can be explained by variation in flu virus or flu infection dated before flu shot protection is formed.

                Even though flu viruses each year are different, flu shot can achieve an <a class="intext_citation" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm">effectiveness of 43.8%</a> in 10 years average. Even though the expectation is to completely prevent flu infection, but because of various factors, such as variation in flu virus and difference in individual immune system, it is hard to guarantee complete prevention of flu. Nevertheless, there is no harm to get a flu vaccine to get the protection. In worse case scenario, flu vaccine can relief flu symptoms even if infected.
