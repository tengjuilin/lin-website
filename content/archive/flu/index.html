            <p class="masked_section_text xr-texture1">
                Supported by numerous studies, flu vaccine is the most effective and safe prevention method that can reduce flu symptoms, if not preventing flu infection. Despite its effectiveness, Seattle still has a low flu vaccination rate that can pose risks to people who are vulnerable to major diseases.
