|Why doesn't this repo have 68k stars instead of 68?! Hi @tengjuilin, you've saved me countless number of hours! I have been switching back and forth between Word and LaTeX, every time refactoring some aspect only to realize it's not worth it, then switching to the other only to re-learn the quirks that originally made me switch, and it's been a broken cycle! I don't know how to thank you enough :)|
nice repo! Thanks! How could I buy you a coffee/beer?
Nice repo to create markdown resume!

|One of the best GSIs I've had at Berkeley; Teng-Jui was always helpful and very patient with students. He paid close attention to weekly feedback from his class, and did an excellent job at adapting to where students thought improvements could be made during lab time.|
Nothing but great things to say about Owen. Very knowledgeable and always willing to help.
Love Owen!
Keep it up. I honestly thought that you would be another one of those super bad GSIs when I went to your first lab section, but the last couple I've been to were a massive step up from before. I really appreciate how you not only ask for improvements, but you actually put those improvements into place. Being a GSI in general is a fairly thankless job, so thanks!
I think Owen was a really great GSI. He really knew the material and explained it in an understandable way. He always cared about improving his teaching, so he would consistently ask us questions (or in the beginning had google forms) about how he could structure lab time to be more effective in learning for us. He answered questions in a way that made sense and helped us learn. Overall, I benefited a lot from his teaching. I didn't end up going to all of the actual labs in person for other reasons, but even in the review sessions and in the lectures that he taught us in class, he was really good.
I went to lab a few times, but from those few times and the overall set-up of the lab, you can tell he really cared about the students learning. Lots of time and effort went into planning these labs.
Very well-prepared lecture content and well-articulated explanations. Available for help in lab. Very understanding of absences and accomodations.
Amazing understanding gsi. very knowledgeable and engaging
He was a great teacher overall. I could tell that he put a ton of work into the lessons, especially if he was the one fully putting together all of the lab lessons that were super comprehensive and in-depth and relatively long as well. He cared a lot about getting our feedback on his teaching and wanted to make sure that we were having the best experience possible and learning the most.
Very prepared and well thought out lectures
Knowledgable and helpful with questions.
Teng-Jui was very accessible, quick to respond, and adaptable. He was patient with students and worked to make the labs as valuable as possible for our education and our careers.
very good
Very helpful and caring. Always organized and does his best to help us on exams and for the future!
Teng-j’ai was always very cheerful and willing to help. Understanding we all have different coding backgrounds and understanding. Continuously asking for feedback to improve.
The TA did an amazing job of integrating feedback into lessons right away and giving lots of helpful examples before asking us to try practice problems on our own
thank you
I never went to lab but Owen was pretty cool. I really appreciated how open he was to student feedback and how accessible he was.
Went over all the problems in the labs and did good explanations of the topics being covered
Explained and broke down difficult concepts perfectly
Responds to feedback very well. Effective speaker. Very knowledgeable.
I loved that he was open/encouraged feedback and actively implemented that feedback to better the students' learning experience.
good at teaching
Explained topics thoroughly. Was receptive to weekly feedback.
Very engaging caring and cheerful. Labs were fun and interactive.
He always explains topics clearly and answers complex questions with respect and eagerness to help
I like the fact that example problems are provided prior to the actual problem during the lab. This makes it easier for the student to visual and follow along with the coding aspect of this class.
Lab assignments were very well-organized, instructor was responsive to feedback
preparing the material and the lecture.using many survey questions and changing the instructions according to feedback
He presented the lab problems and solutions well, making them seem simple
Thank you for the great lecture.
Really did carry the course in terms of preparing material and availability, and often took feedback. Unfortunately, teaching style did not personally work for me (explanations to individual questions were a bit scant).
Very good with answering questions and explaining concepts after giving us time to work on it
Fast communication, supportive, helpful when explaining course content
The teaching assistant was very helpful and clearly explained course concepts when students were having difficulties.
Fast paced but overall was effective.
Very helpful and provides great resources
enjoyed his lectures a lot. Very clear delivery and seems knowledgable about the subject. Midterm 2 review lecture was very helpful. Slides were helpful for reviewing content.
He is very hard working and ensures all students do well. He is knowledgable and quick to correct student's errors and solve their doubts.
GSI continues to adjust the lecture depending on the students’ wants and needs.
Discussion/Lab sections were amazing. Taught new material while expanding/relating to old/adjacent material that was being taught in the class.
Engaging demos and very adept in the course material. Shows consistent dedication and passion to teaching.
He did well with examples and the management of the lab section.
Organized, receptive to feedback, helpful when you ask a question
The lab instructor was able to effectively explain new concepts while still leaving time to assist students with their lab assignments.
Very good at responding to and requesting feedback after each lab. Very organized labs.
Providing resources, giving/taking good notes, being well-prepared
Labs have a lot of information and made it easy to understand the role that each line of code played. Theoretical aspects behind methods were also explained very well.
Answered questions at the level they were being asked. I felt like I could ask him any questions about material.
Very organized and had an approachable and kind attitude
He was very good at listening to what kind of lectures are best for us and changed his teaching style to make sure we could follow along.
very organized and responsive
Organized the labs well and every lab asked for our feedback on how he was teaching the course.
Amazing pacing/teaching. Would expand on the material at a good pace, adjust pace depending on material difficultly to best teach the course. Overall amazing.
The explanation where well done
