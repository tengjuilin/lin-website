"As graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, Ms. Hillman and Mr. Lin have raised awareness around issues of data visualization and inference by analyzing thousands of papers for misleading data presentation via graph axes, dimensional distortions, and colormaps. This team has shared their work via preprints ([1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.20.609464v2), [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.12.659203v1)) and provided guidance to the community on how to present data in more transparent and interpretable ways."
