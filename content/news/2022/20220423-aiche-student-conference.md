**Title**: Robust Microglial Shape Analysis using Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition

**Abstract**: We optimized and incorporated Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition into our Python-based shape analysis pipeline to classify morphology of microglia, the brainâ€™s immune cells, and characterized them using shape metrics reproducibly in a high-throughput manner. We showed changes in microglial shape in response to injury and treatment in model systems.
